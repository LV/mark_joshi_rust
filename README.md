# C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives Pricing
***In Rust!***

The point of this repository was to give me a good excuse to read the book, all while not getting completely bored at looking at the code and trying to get it working on my own. I figured that because I had not yet created a project in Rust (and this wouldn't be a bad fit for this project), I would go ahead and do it.

Feel free to post any issues relating to any errors I may have made while porting the code.
